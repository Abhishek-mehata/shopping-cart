# Shopping Cart Overview

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a simplified e-commerce application built with React to
demonstrate how basic functionalities of platforms like Amazon and Daraz
work behind the scenes.

It focuses on implementing core frontend features such as product
browsing, cart management, checkout flow, and state handling using
modern React tools.

The main goal of this project is educational --- to understand how
dynamic cart systems and routing work in real-world e-commerce
applications.
